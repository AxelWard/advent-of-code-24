Well today's problem was a lot easier than I initially thought it would be. When I first looked at
the problem I had no real idea what the best solution would be, but after thinking on it for a bit
I realized that if we precalculated each path cell's distance from the goal it would be really easy
to check how much time a shortcut would save. For part 1 set up manual checks with directional
vectors, and for part 2 I just had it iterate through every path cell reachable from the start cell
in at most 20 steps.

Not too difficult at all, especially for a problem this deep in the event!

+2 precalculated stars.

See you tomorrow gamers.
