Good morning gamers! Thank god day 22 was an easy one, I needed a win like this.

Today part one took all of 5 minutes to implement, which concerned me bigtime for part 2. That said,
I found an O(N)(?) solution that is all about just iterating through calculations, and saving results
as you go.

+2 stars as we go.

See you tomorrow gamers.
