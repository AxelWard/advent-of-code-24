Another day, another hash map. Seriously today's solution came to me pretty quick. I realized
that if I was to try to brute force calculate all the matches possible it'd be pretty much
impossible to run on a large set of data. So rather I just implemented a recursive match
calculation that checked if a previously visited length had any matches.

+2 more hashed stars.

See you tomorrow gamers.
