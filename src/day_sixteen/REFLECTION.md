Holy guacamole, what a day... well, 2 days.

Its day 17, and I'm just now finishing day 16. I struggled really hard with part 2 of this problem,
particularly just keeping the data tracking straight in my head. I'm sure if I wasn't so busy with
holidays and work then it would be much easier to have done this, but oh well.

My implementation for part 1 was pretty straightforward pathfinding, and it got me like 95% of the
way to part 2, but good god the last 5% took me forever. It turns out I just needed to track the
previous cell(s) and scores for each direction, instead of just at the cell level. The rest was
just implementing the logic to track those things.

+2 very delayed, and very tired, stars.

See you tomorrow gamers.
