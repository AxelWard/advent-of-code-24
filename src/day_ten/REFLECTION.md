Good morning gamers! I just finished part 2 of problem 10, but something one of a kind happened
today. As I was working on part 1 I had a flaw in my logic where I ended up counting the total
number of paths instead of the number of 9's that each start reached. However, part 2 was exactly
that. So with a quick spam of the undo key I was right back to the correct solution.

+1 star on purpose, +1 star on accident.

See you tomorrow gamers.
