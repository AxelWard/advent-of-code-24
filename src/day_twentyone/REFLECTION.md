Boy howdy... Day twenty one almost did me in. I first started with a massively overly-complicated
solution that I show off a bit in my whiteboard photo for this day. Lets just say, KISS is a solid
principle.

I was trying to avoid writing explicit rules to avoid the non-button square, but by doing so I
ended up with a bug riddled solution that had way more complexity than I needed. Lesson learned, the
best way to do things sometimes is the seemingly verbose way.

Oh yeah, and hashmaps for part 2 again, lol.

+2 Very late stars (its January 2nd).

See you tomorrow gamers.
