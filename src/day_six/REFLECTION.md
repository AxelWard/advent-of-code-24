Well zoo wee mama today was challenging. I was pretty distracted, between a work party and some
rocket league, it took me a solid chunk of probably close to 7 hours to finish today's problem. I
don't expect this to be the norm, especially considering I got part one done in about 10 minutes.

Part 2 had one minor stumbling block in that I wasn't considering that if you put a block on a
previously visited path then you would not be able to reach the place where you need to actually
put the block down. That cost me a good three hours, woo hoo!

Anyways, my solution to part 2 is pretty good, although it does take a little while to run. I
wonder if there are different micro-optimizations I can do to make things run a little quicker. but
on the more interesting side I did get to play with Zig comptime a bit today which was fun, and I
also learned a bit more about how pointer operations work in Zig! Woohoo low level!

I'm leaving day 6 on a cautiously optimistic note. Despite the struggles I still had fun working
through the problem, and god that dopamine hit when my solution finally worked. Nothing beats it.

+2 stars that the guards can't reach because they're stuck in nineteen hundred and thirty three
loops.

See you tomorrow gamers.
