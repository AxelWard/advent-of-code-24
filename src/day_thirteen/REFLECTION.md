Alright algebra! How y'all doing?

Jokes aside, this is the first time in a while I've had to do for real algebra on my whiteboard.
Thanks day 13! It really showed me how rusty my math skills are, and that it might be time to
sharpen those up so I can at least pass a fifth grade math test without googling anything.

For real though, I immediately reckognized that this was just a "Solve a system of equations
problem" but that didn't mean that I was out of the woods. I had to do some fun whiteboard math to
produce the equations I ended up using (whiteboard_math.jpg). This honestly took me a lot longer
than I'd like to admit, but we did it!

+2 system of starquations.

See you tomorrow gamers.
