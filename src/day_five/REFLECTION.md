Alrighty. Day 5. This was definitely another pretty big step up from the previous days. It took me
about 2 hours to get through this one, although part of that was due to using the wrong buffer when
I was trying to read through the input.

My solutions today allowed me to explore memory managment a bit more, as I had to deal with parsing
in a set of rules and then check those rules to check if the inputs were valid. I also spent some
more time with iterators and arrays, which feels like great practice for future days and projects.

Overall I think I'm starting to settle into using Zig and getting more comfortable with low level
functionality.

+2 stars, emphatically.

See you tomorrow gamers.
