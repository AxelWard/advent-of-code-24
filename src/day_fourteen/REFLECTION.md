Two math days in a row! Fun! Today was a simple velocity/boundary snapping problem for part one.
My solution is fairly simple, you take the bots position, then add the velocity times the number of
seconds you want to simulate, and then take the modulus of the final position and the grid width
and height. This gives you the bots final location in the grid, and then its just a matter of
counting the number of bots in each quadrant.

Part 2 was a little more confusing. I didn't even know what the prompt really meant (maybe I'm just
tired, idk) so I looked for a little bit of guidance on the sub-reddit. I saw that the bots just
arrange them into a christmas tree shape with a border box around it, so I wrote a simple check to
look for that border box and voila, that worked!

+2 box detection stars.

See you tomorrow gamers.
