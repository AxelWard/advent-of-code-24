Well here we are. Day 2, and I'm already annoyed with myself lol. I ended up implementing what I
see as a brute force solution, where I'm checking the line for errors, and if I find any errors I
check the line over again, except this time I check it once with each value removed until I either
find a line that works or don't find one. Brute force, worst case N squared. I really need to get
better at data structures and algorithms lol

One solution I tried was storing the index that caused the error, and then removing the values
before, on, and immediately after the index and checking those sub-arrays. So then worst case it
would be 4N. I'm not sure if I was on the right track here, or if I was chasing up the wrong tree.
Tomorrow when I have fresh eyes I'm gonna look at a different solution to mine and see if I missed
something obviouse, but I feel like I probably did.

Either way, I worked today, and then I worked on this for almost 2 hours (yikes, 12 hours total).
I'm gonna go hang out with Logan and try to decompress. I think I should probably attempt these
problems first thing in the morning haha.

Regardles, +2 more stars.

See you tomorrow gamers.

EDIT:

I went and looked at other solutions. I think I was on the right track with the first solution I
was attempting but probably was just making indexing mistakes (seeing as how my answers were only
one or two off this is probably the case). I feel less bad now. Probably just Zig skill diff if
we're being honest. Oh well, this is why I'm doing this. I can make silly mistakes and resort to
brute force now instead of in a big project :)

Actually see you tomorrow gamers.
